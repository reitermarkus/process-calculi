% This is a description of the Monty Hall problem based
% on the American tv show called Let's Make a Deal. The 
% question is what the best strategy is for a player to
% select a prize hidden behind one of three doors. The
% player can point at one door, but it will then receive
% the information behind which of the remaining doors the
% prize is certainly not located. The player can then point
% again at one of the two remaining doors. The question is
% should he stick to his original choice or change to the
% other door.

% Below the variant is listed where the player switches the door.
% To investigate the strategy where the door is not switched,
% the inequality != should be replaced by equality ==.
