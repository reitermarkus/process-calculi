Follow these steps to create an FSM file for input to the visualization tools:

1. Choose an mCRL2 specification in one of the examples directories.

2. Assuming the file name of the specification is foo.mcrl2, create an LPS using
   the lineariser:
   $ mcrl22lps foo.mcrl2 foo.lps

3. Now generate a state space in mCRL2 fsm format:
   $ lps2lts foo.lps foo.fsm
