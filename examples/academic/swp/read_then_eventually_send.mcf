% Formula that expresses that if a message is read through r1, then it is
% eventually send through s4.

% This property does not hold for the alternating bit protocol, as it does not
% assume fairness. This can be shown by the formula "infinitely_often_lost.mcf"
%
% The file "read_then_eventually_send_if_fair.mcf" contains a formula that
% shows that the property holds if fairness is assumed.
